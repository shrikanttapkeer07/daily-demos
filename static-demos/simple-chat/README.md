# Daily.co chat demo 
This demo mirrors our [css-grid-demo](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-demos/tree/main/static-demos/css-grid-demo), with added chat functionality. 

It makes use of the Daily.co API [`sendAppMessage()` instance method](https://docs.daily.co/reference#%EF%B8%8F-sendappmessage) and corresponding [`app-message` event](https://docs.daily.co/reference#app-message) to set up barebones chat. 

You can read more about how this implementation works on our blog (link TBD). 

For a more sophisticated chat solution, in particular one that stores and displays history, stay tuned for tutorials on integrating Daily with third-party API's.
